I have created a web application that enables users to connect to my website using MetaMask and securely send Ethereum to another account. Additionally, users have the ability to view their transaction history, stay updated on Ethereum-related news, and access the latest updates on various cryptocurrencies. This project serves as an excellent opportunity to practice and gain a deeper understanding of creating your own smart contracts using Hardhat.
